# project-k
this is my first repositry made by me which is very special for me and now i m checking that all the work done by me is correct or not
git clone to clone a file or folder
 wrote hello everyone to check git status 

 using (git add file_name) command to add the untracked files(unknown by git or don't know about the new files by git) single file 
 whole file command syntax (git add .)

now to commit git use command (git commit -m)


to pust the git into git hub u have to use the command called git push origin main
where the origin is name of the main repositry(where we cloned) and main is the branch name .
